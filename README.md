# Game of NFTs

Game of NFTs (GoN) is a program that provides public environments where the Interchain NFT Transfer technology can be extensively tested with community support and innovations can be created pioneeringly.

The program includes two phases:
- **Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnets (Kick Off Now!)**
- Phase 2 - Hackathon (April 2023)

Phase 1 of GoN now kicks off at **2023-03-01-06:00 UTC**, and we have a number of tasks and rewards scheduled. Rewards will be distributed based on a point system, and allocated to winners who have completed certain tasks and submit an entry for dedicated awards.

## Overview

Through the several rounds, participants are expected to gain knowledge and build an understanding of the Interchain NFTs feature and assist in the discovery of interesting attack vectors.	

The testnet infrastructure includes:

- [ICS-721 Enabled SDK and Wasm Chains](./doc/testnet-info.md#chain-information)
- [ICS-721 IBC Channels and Ports](./doc/port-channel-table.md)
- [Support Services in Cosmos Discord](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/1074987031270268958)
- [Testnet Faucets](./doc/testnet-info.md#faucet)
- [Testnet Explorers](./doc/testnet-info.md#explorer)

Participants will utilize all GoN testnets for feature-testing, and for completing multiple tasks.

üí¨ Event coordinators will be available in the [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel

üìç A leaderboard will be available at https://interchainnfts.dev/gon/scoreboard.html

## Join & Evidence Submission

According to information provided via the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIhkXzOUTNu5R2cueCSt-_0Dic4MdsF193I9GSx64YTqNyWw/viewform), eligible participants have been invited into [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel to start coordinating their participation.

Before you start testing, please kindly check the join & evidence submission guidance provided at [gon-evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence).
 - Step 1. You need to submit [qualification evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#qualification-evidence-submission) to upload basic team information
 - Step 2. After that, you need to add each [task evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#task-evidence-submission) into your own `info` sheet as required and submit for verification and scoring
 - Step 3. For special award application, you should submit issues based on [award application](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#award-application) for judging
 - Step 4. During the testing phase, if you find a bug/issue, please report based on [bug submission](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence#bug-submission)

In order to verify the authenticity of identity, ensure fairness of the game, and protect participants' rights in receiving points and claiming rewards, please make sure to submit evidence as required.

*Please note that all submissions will be public, so please make sure to **create new addresses of test chains** to participate in the public testing.*

## Disclaimers
 1. The final number of points awarded to each participant is at the discretion of the testnet judges.
 2. The timeline for all stages and rounds may change depending on the outcome of previous activities.
 3. Available tasks/awards and points may be adjusted during the course of the testnet program.
 4. All evidence submitted for scoring points must be submitted to [gon-evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence) as required.

## Timeline

The Incentivized Testnets has 3 stages with different tasks. Tasks will be revealed gradually as the game progresses.

Participants can refer [the installation doc](doc/installation.md) to install the client software and [the instruction doc](./doc/instruction-ics721.md) to get familiar with Interchain NFTs Transfer operations.

### Stage 1: Welcome to GoN

**Duration**: Mar 1-3

- Create Collections and NFTs
- Perform Interchain NFTs Transfer

**Round 1: Warm-ups**

IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno, Uptick and OmniFlix have prepared their testnets, allowing participants to create their collections and NFTs. These NFTs can be used for the next transfer tasks of the game, marking the first time participants can experience Interchain NFT Transfer.

**Rules:** 
- Participant issue their own classes(collections, denoms) and must set class data as the JSON string below
- This allows participants to bind their classes to their GitHub account and prove they have control of the class owner
- All the following tasks related to NFT transfer must be minted under their classes
- Class owner must be the IRISnet address of each pariticipant at the time of registration

```json
{
  "github_username": "username, this is a must",
  "discord_handle": "discord handle, this is optional",
  "team_name": "your team name, this is optional",
  "community": "if you come from a community"
}
```

**Tasks**ÔºöA1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6


### Stage 2: Let's Dive into Interchain NFTs Transfer

Duration: Mar 6-10

- Perform Interchain NFT Transfer through different flows


### Stage 3: Enjoy the Carnival of GoN

Duration: Mar 13-24

- Competitive race game
- Quiz game

In addition to tasks, there will be contributor awards for rewarding community-contributed content and tools, i.e, auditing services, public goods, community supports, NFT memes.

## Point System

### General Tasks

General tasks allow participants to fully experience the NFT-transfer functionality. These tasks will be locked once the 3rd stage has begun, participants must submit evidence generated before then (based on the specified block height). Details of flow and flow style in the task description can be found [here](./doc/flow-table.md).
